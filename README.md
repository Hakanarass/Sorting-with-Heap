# Sorting-with-Heap
Sorting with Heap
The program compares running times by applying heap sort, java sort, and selection sort algorithms to various array sizes. 
The user starts the program by entering the desired number in the variable “size” in the input of the program. 
The program gives the duration and average duration of each algorithm as output.

The program creates 3 different arrays and uses the “deepCopy” method to copy the contents of one array into two other arrays. 
Then it measures the duration of the algorithms.

1. Selection Sort Algorithm
In this assignment, I used Selection Sort algorithm for sort a list in ascending order. 
Firstly, algorithm finds a smallest number in array and swaps it with first element. 
It then finds the smallest number remaining and swaps it with the second element, and so on, until only a single number remains.

2. HeapSort Method
heapSort method creates a heap and places the numbers in the array into the heap. 
All values are removed from the heap and placed inversely in the array. Therefore, the array is sorted.

3. Sample Outputs
In this section, I provided three outputs of my program. 
By improving the output of the program on written paper, I showed the time in all algorithms for each array in the output as output on the same line. 
Thus, the user will be able to compare the times with each other and see in detail which one will be shorter.
